    <h2>Tasty Biryani:</h2>
    <p>Using saffron and ghee are two best ways to bring that perfect aroma and 
    deliciousness to your Biryani. At the time of assembling Biryani, top the
    dish with saffron soaked in milk to give it a wonderful color and pour some
     ghee to elevate the flavor.</p>

     <h2>Step 1:</h2>
     <p>Prepare saffron-kewra water and chop veggies To make a delightful chicken
         biryani dish firstly soak saffron in water to prepare saffron water 
         (One tsp saffron can be soaked in 1/4 cup water). Next, mix kewra drops
          in water and mix well to make kewra water. Set them aside for later usage.
           Now chop the onion and coriander leaves and keep them aside.
        </p>
        <h2>Step 2:</h2>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, heat refined oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the oil is hot
             enough, add cumin seeds, bay leaf, green cardamom, black cardamom,
              cloves in it, and saute for about a minute. Then, add chopped onion to
               it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken into it with slit green 
               chillies, turmeric, salt to taste, ginger garlic paste, red chilli 
               powder and green chilli paste. Mix well all the spices and cook for
                2-3 minutes. Then, add hung curd into it and give a mix. 
                (Make sure the chicken is washed properly and patted dry before
                 adding it to the dish)

            <h2>Step 3:</h2>

         <p>
            Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with
             ginger julienned, coriander and mint leaves. Add kewra water, rose water
              and saffron water in it. Cook till the chicken is tender. Then add 1 
              cup cooked rice and spread evenly. Then add saffron water and pour ghee
               over it. You can now cook the dish without the lid or cover it with 
               a lid to give a dum-effect due to the steam formation.
